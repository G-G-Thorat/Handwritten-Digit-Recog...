# Handwritten-Digit-Recog...
The project works on the handwritten style of writing any numbers in any font using keyboard or mouse and identifies its exact digit using Python modules.

The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different flavors. The handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image

Install the necessary libraries for this project using this command:
pip install numpy, tensorflow, keras, pillow,

STEPS:

1. Import the libraries and load the dataset
2. Preprocess the data
3. Create the model
4. Train the model
5. Evaluate the model
6. Create GUI to predict digits
